We designed a website for a gym called “Powerhouse” The website allows the user to become
a gym member by filling out a form in which a user can choose between 4 courses (cycling,
kickboxing, aqua, and Pilates) to enroll in. The user can learn more about each course, the plans,
as well as the instructors. Once the user submits the form, he/she will automatically have a
profile on the website that will include all the information submitted in the form.
